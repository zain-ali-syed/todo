# todo
Fullstack todo application with JWT authentication - React, Node, Express, JWT and MongoDB

Yes! Yet another todo app. However it does tie a lot of different concepts together as a full stack app. This todo app implements React/Redux on the front-end. On the backend - MongoDB for the database, JWT for authentication (login and registration) and Express as the webserver on a Node backend.
